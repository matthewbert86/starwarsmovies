# starwarsmovies

This is a vanilla JavaScript application that allows you to search for a particular Star Wars movie, and returns information about that movie to the user.

<p>This app utilizes a JSON file for all the Star Wars data, and I used fetch to pull the data and return it. All directions on how it was built is in notes in the JS file for the project.</p>
